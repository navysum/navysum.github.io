      <p>PUBG stands for <b>PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS</b>.The game is developed by Brendan Greene whose gaming name is PlayerUnknown. So thats how the game go its name eventually. The game is all about fighting for survival. 100 players will be dropped in a island. They must collect weapons, armor, use vehicles and all available resources to stay away from enemies or chase and kill the enemies. Its literally a fierce battle between you and your fellow mates who dropped with you from the airplane. Thus the name Battlegrounds.</p>
